# EMG-Analysis

Objective
The aim is to measure and analyze muscle activation in the biceps and triceps during movements like flexion, extension, bicep curls, and punching, comparing healthy and neuropathic subjects.

Methodology
Subjects: 26-year-old female participants (healthy and neuropathic).
Tasks:
  1. Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) for biceps and triceps.
  2. Bicep curls.
  3. Punching.
Setup:
  - Bipolar electrode configuration.
  - 2000 Hz sampling rate with TMSI SAGA amplifier.
  - Signal processing included filtering, enveloping, and indexing.

Key Findings
- Healthy subjects exhibited higher MVC amplitudes than neuropathic individuals.
- Repetitive tasks led to muscle fatigue, which is evident in signal reduction over time.
- Bicep curls and punching demonstrated distinct activity patterns:
Curls: Low flexing activity in biceps.
Punching: Triphasic patterns in fast movements.
- Secondary muscles showed minor activity during exercises.

Conclusions
- Muscle fatigue was evident with repetitive tasks, highlighting reduced motor neuron responsiveness.
- sEMG effectively differentiates muscle activity in healthy versus neuropathic conditions.
- This technique could aid in diagnosing neurological conditions like cerebral palsy or stroke.
